## How to Start Building Your Content with the Simple Donation Theme

Before getting started, note that some templates will require additional configuration within your organization upon installation. For example, you’ll need to add the following templates to your template picklist:

For guidance, refer to our [Help Article: How to Add Templates to the Template Picklist](https://help.getstoreconnect.com/documentation/adding-templates-to-content-template-picklist.html).

Each template supports specific fields and options when setting up your content blocks. Below, you'll find a list of supported fields. Keep in mind that you can continue using the rest of the out-of-the-box templates to build your site. Consult the [content block templates](https://help.getstoreconnect.com/documentation/content-block-templates.html) help article for a complete overview of the supported fields for each template.
